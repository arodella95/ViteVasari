# ViteVasari
This repository contains the plain text version (also in lower case) of
Le Vite dei pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori by Giorgio Vasari.
There's also the words list.
I am passionate about art history and as part of a university project
i had the opportunity to carry out some analyses of giorgio vasari's lives.
These analyses required a plain text version, which i created specifically for this reason.
I hope it could be useful!
